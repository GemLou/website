<div class="p1">
    <p>The benefits of Trello and Pinterest have been incredible, they have really helped me plan and generate ideas, and without having access to them I would have struggled a lot more and felt less productive because of this. However, I have had a lot of problems with CSS and being confused and it is difficult to want to do something when you are so frustrated by it, I definitely feel like I have procrastinated a little due to this. I definitely think that a website would be easier to create in a week with a group, getting everyone to work on a page each would be perfect; in a week as an individual, I've found it quite hard and very stressful, and I most definitely haven't been as efficient as I would've liked, mostly due to things going wrong!</p>

<div class="q2">
    <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h2>
</div>

<div class="p2">
    <p>More sleep and regular breaks; both things I didn't do throughout this project. I found that I also did better when I got stuck, just to move on to something else and go back to what I was struggling with, instead of getting stressed about that and wasting time, but it is very difficult to be productive when you keep getting things wrong and you're so unmotivated.</p>

<div class="q33">
    <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects.</h2>

</div>

<div class="p3">
    <p> Ask. For. More. Help. I am the worst person when it comes to suffering in silence, and that is really one of the main things I have taken from this; if I ask for help I can probably get through it faster because I'm not struggling and being stressed. I also think I would have an accurate plan, I looked at inspiration images, but didn't really concept, so it was really hard to envision and decide what I actually wnated, and this made me waste more time; I definitely think more planning would mean more efficient work-flow.</p>

    Generally it's just a lot of trial and error and a lot of googling, if I have a problem I usually google it, with coding I'll look at other people's code and compare it to mine to see what I could have done wrong. In the past if I have had a problem that I can't find the answer to (3D Modelling), I'll post in a forum and usually people are super helpful, they check out your file and see what the problem is; I haven't yet had to do this with coding as there are thousands of resources out there, which I am so thankful for. Sometimes it just helps to watch video's or look at other individuals works.
