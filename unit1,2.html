        <p>So I began the project by using Trello, which is great as it helped me plan thorougly. After learning Python first I have found HTML very easy to use so I am happy that I got to use this, CSS has baffled me a tad bit, I think because there's quite a lot to it, it's also completely different to what I expected! VS Code is the main tool really, and I honestly enjoy using it a lot, it's really easy to get around and you can do so much with it, so overall I am quite happy with what I have been using thus far. </p>

    <div class="rightq">
        <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools<br> selected were appropriate.</h2>

    <div class="rightp">
        <p>I don't have any prior coding experience before CodeNation, and I really think they made this course so that it is as easy as possible for their students to be able to transfer between languages. I feel like the software used is definitely appropriate as everything is very similar, so it wasn't just about throwing us in at the deep end, there was a method there! Honestly I really enjoy using HTML and CSS, especially since this is my first time, it can all be done in VS Code too which I love. I don't think I could've started out my coding journey with better software.</p>

        <p>
            I think the main strength of my site is the fact it is easy to get around, super straight-foward and accessible. I also think that the amount of content is great, I have a lot of written work and lengthy replies to questions. However, I am an artist and I don't quite like the way the site looks, it is so simple, and quite plain, but my main focus was just to get a working site with some content, as we were quite short on time. If I could change something I'd definitely make it more personalised by drawing my own illustrations to decorate the site with and showcase my artistic side!

    <div class="rightq">
        <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="rightp">
        <p> This website for me is definitely going to be a work in progress, a week was not enough time for all of my ideas and I want to use this site as a way to show my art and for companies and recruiters to find out more about me. I eventually want to have a super cute looking site, with hand-drawn icons, images and animations.</p>

        <p>
            I believe my website fits into the criteria, I have demonstarted I can make a website using links, buttons and various other kinds of design elements, even though it is very simple, it works fully and I have shown my abaility to coe throughout.

            Even though I am not 100% happy with the way it looks, it functions and has all of the content it needs, so overall it is fit for purpose!
