        <h2 class="q1">1.1 Describe the purpose of<br> IT in modern business.</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="p1">
        <p>IT and tech are both used in a multitude of ways in modern business.
        <br>
        <br>
        Firstly, I want to discuss how technology has influenced retail businesses. As we know, most retail businesses have online platforms where customers can buy proucts; whether this is an app, or a website. Think about all of the stresses of modern life, working long hours, mental health problems, physicl disabilities etc, there are many people out there who can't get out of the house or simply don't have the time to go shopping. Shopping doesn't mean just essenstials such as food; shopping means all kinds of things: clothing, shoes, makeup, toys, anything! 
        <br> 
        <br>   
        Now, consider the amount of people who suffer from mental health, who work long hours, who don't want to spend their weekends queing for hours in packed shops only to leave with a pack of bobbles. With this there are so many people who just wouldn't visit shops physically, and this is why tech is so important in the retail business, it allows companies to gain more sales as they are providing a service that everyone with wifi can use, as opposed to just getting sales from people who visit their shops; more sales = more profit! The same can also be said for people who want to set up a small bsuiness, many people cannot afford to buy a building for a shop, so the best alternative is an online shop, the internet can be all the difference for someone being able to pay their rent or not.
        <br>
        <br>
        Not only does IT make it easier for businesses to make profit, or for businesses to get started, but IT also allows better communication between businesses, employees and clients, making for a smoother and more effective company. Many professional conversations take place throughout emails as well as meeting platforms such as Slack and Zoom; imagine an urgent company matter, where the business could be collapsing and action needs to be taken asap to ensure this doesn't happen (not the best example but I'm running with it), so if IT didn't exist and we didn't have all of these incredible ways of communicating, how would we take immediate action? Posting a letter could take days, by that time the imminent death of your business has already happened, whereas a laptop allows you to have all information with you at all times; files, folders, data and emails, so you can have a speedy reply sent out to all colleagues, partners and employees within seconds.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are millions of ways IT has been implemented into modern business and I have only described 1/300th of it. I believe without IT in modern businesses, many would fail.

        <h2>1.2 Describe methods, skills and resources<br> needed to complete digital projects successfully.</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="p2">
        <p> I have had a tonne of experience with digital projects, as my entire 3 years spent at university, were based on digital projects. I find that the sole way to start off a project is concepting and planning, no matter what the project is; plan, plan, plan! Planning can be done easily by using things like Trello, which I have used for this project. Sometimes people also get ideas out of the workplace, the way I jot these down is by using notes in my phone, I find they help a great deal, and pinterest boards are also super amazing for visal ideas, planning and research. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Another huge part of having a successful project is time-management skills, having a set deadline for each task is super helpful and very motivating, if you see you have a deadline, you are more likely to work towards it as opposed to being all over the place procrastinating. Another super helpful skill to have is problem solving! Things happen all the time with projects, things go wrong and you need to be able to deal with this calmly and positively to get your project underway as fast as possible again, determing the problems and ensuring that the problem doesn't keep happening is super important, and again this fits into time-management, if you have problems you can't solve, your time-management is going to be atrocious. Communication skills are a given, especially for team projects, but also for individual projects, you can learn so much by asking others for help, and sometimes this can solve your problem faster than if you were doing it alone.
        <br>
        <br>
        A given really for digital projects is having the right technology. The right technology does wonders for a project, my university course required to run a lot of very powerful software, which could often cause computers to crash, if they weren't good enough to handle the program. Crashes, losing work, and freezing are all things you want to avoid, so make sure you have the right specs for something before you start it, to save yourself a world of frustration. I always make sure I own a laptop with an i7 processor, 16GB RAM and at least 500 SSD so all of my projects run smoothly. Having access to the correct software is another given.
        <br>
        <br>
        Also remember: Google is your friend! </p>

    <div>
        <h2 class="q3">1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT.</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="p3">
        
        <p>I previously mentioned using a Trello board to plan my website and track its progress, you can see what my trello looks like <a href="https://trello.com/b/j4a6Crt7/gems-website" target="_blank">here.</a> I find it super easy to use the kanban method to plot my site dev journey! <br>I also made a <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/ooheaven_eyesoo/sites/" target="_blank">Pinterest board</a>, to help me generate ideas for how I want my site to look, mostly for colour schemes and layout!</p>
    
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="q4">1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects.</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="p4">
        <p>I think a lot of risks come from poor time-management, you could essentially fail a project due to missing the deadline. Projects can fail for so many reasons however. For instance if you didn't plan properly, and now your project is all over the place and isn't at all what you wanted, whether it doesn't work or it simply isn't good enough. Lack of communication can make team projects fail, if you aren't having regular meetings and no one is organsied, this is going to be a massive issue, some teammates may work on the same thing unknowingly, and you could end up with the same work doubled whilst work is lacking in another section. If you aren't all coordinated then you could waste time, linking to my first point.
        <br>
        <br>
        Trivial things can also make projects fail, such as losing work, computers breaking, work being lost, not saving things and having to spend more time doing them again. Also, unrealistic plans and expectations, sometimes it's hard to wind your ideas in and compile them to make something simpler (I know from experience), if you have crazy ideas and give yourself more to do than what is necessary, you're likely to fail... The key is to get it done for the deadline, then improve as you see fit after that.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="q5">1.5 Describe how you would go about<br> selecting and using IT systems and software.</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="p5">
        <p>Depending on the project, I would try to use software I am more familiar with, so I can get the job done faster and so I am not having to study as well as do a project. In my spare time I tend to learn new software and new ways of doing things, but whilst I am doing a project I try my hardest to use what I already know, whilst researching minor things, for instance if I forget something. Other forms of technology so laptops and things, should be selected to suit the software, as different software requires different levels of power, and if this is going to be an issue, then it is maybe better to select a program that requires lower specs and try to learn it as you go along, as the time you spend waiting when the computer crashes will probably be more wasteful than learning new software as you use it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Choosing the right software can be problematic, you may not be able to afford the software so you may have to find a cheaper alternative that maybe doesn't do exactly what you want, it may be that the more expensive software has everything you need, and in order to equal this, you need to buy multiple cheaper softwares to get everything you would get if you paid more. So that's something to think about, do you pay more and get exactly what you need? Or do you pay less and botch it together? Only certain softwares are on MAC or Windows, if you have Windows, then obviously you have to get one suited to that and vice versa.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="q6">1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="p6">
        <p>A few of my chosen technologies such as Trello and Pinterest, have really helped me in the planning stages of my project, and without them it would have been more difficult to get the project started, and would make the project much more difficult to manage. GitHub is also something I will be using.
        <br>
        <br>
        GitHub is a place where developers can upload their code, whether this is in the form of an app or website, and allows them to update their code consistently and easily, this is most commonly known as "version control". The different modification stages are stored in a "central repository", and these can be modified further and used by other developers, allowing dev's to work collaboratively!
        <br>
        <br>
        Honestly GitHub is going to be very useful for me, as I plan to make a lot of changed to my site in the future, so being able to edit code as and when will be perfect.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="q7">1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints<br> that impact digital projects.</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="p7">
        <p>One of the biggest legal guidlines that companies and idividuals must follow when working on certain digital projects is GDPR. GDPR, stands for General Data Protection Regulation. GDPR basically gives us our rights as users online, and this is so important in a world where our personal data is constantly being stored online. Data can be our name, photo's, IP address, bank details, email addresses, and much more.
        <br>
        <br>
        GDPR allows us to ask for access to our personal information, and also ask the company we give our data to how they are using the data, we also have the right for our information to be deleted after a certain amount of time or if we ask to be withdrawn. There are many other ways that GDPR protects us, but how does this affect a digital project?
        <br>
        <br>
        If you do not comply with GDPR rules, you could face fines and also a potential distrust between the customer and your company, as well as a possible scandal. So let's say you are making a wesbite, your website is selling makeup, first you need to figure out what data you will actually be storing and where this will be stored, because if someone asks where their data is and what it is being used for, you need to have it on hand. With most retail sites, your personal payment information as well as delivery information will be stored, so if you are making a shop site, you need to ensure your cutomers know you are taking their personal data. This can be implemented by using tick boxes, were the customer reads your disclaimer/terms of service and chooses to agree or disagree to these. With this being said, you also need to ensure that you have a set time when the data is destroyed after it has been put in the system, so you may have to create a database where the you can add a time tag for when the data needs to be destroyed. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Cookies are also something you will need to ask the user for consent for, cookies will be stored on the users computer and they will send information back to the site, based on the users web searches and how long the user spent on these sites, this means that cookies can be used as a way of marketing products through personalised ads based on the users searches and purchases, so you need to make the consumer very aware of this, how you use the cookies and if they want to opt-in for cookies.
        <br>
        <br>
        Another thing I need to feel the need to talk about is copyright laws, this can really affect a digital project if you aren't following the laws clearly. This is actually something you need to remember even if you aren't selling something. If you are say writing a blog post about videogames, and you are using images as well as other sites information and other peoples writings to quote, you must must must, cite this. Add a link, give credit, quote and citate. Not doing this can be bad and you can plagiarise someone's work which can lead to fines and sometimes prosecution, as it is in fact a criminal offense, especially if you take something from a big site, or copy a logo; your project could be at risk.</p>
