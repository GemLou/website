    <p>As you already know my name is Gemma! I am your regular crazy animal lover - obviously a vegetarian - and I LOVE video games.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p> So I own 11 animals, they are my babies, and I love them all SO MUCH! I get told a lot that I'm crazy for having so many, but they have been a passion of mine since... Forever! My second love though, is my artwork.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p> As of last year I became a graduate in Game Art (yep, that exists!). Before I studied Game Art, I had never touched any 3D art before, but I worked super hard and finished with a First Class Honours! And now here I am, studying coding for the very first time and loving it. As a kid I loved art and video games, growing up I wanted to be a painter, but then I found digital art is more forgiving; I wasn't about to become the next Salvador Dal√≠.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p> The first video game I remember playing is Resident Evil for the PS1. After this I was completely hooked, even though I was around 5 years old, you could find me sat infront of the screen with a controller in my hand. The evolution of videogames is something that is HUGE for me; I went from thinking PS1 graphics were insane, to now playing visually stunning games such as The Last of Us. Creating game ready diorama's has really opened my eyes to the skill it takes to create a video game.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p> I've noticed now that getting into the industry is super difficult, so currently I am trying to upskill by learning coding as well as new 3D Art programmes which I haven't learnt yet. So far I am proficient in:
    <ul>
        <li>3Ds Max</li>
        <li>Maya</li>
        <li>3D Coat</li>
        <li>Substance Painter</li>
        <li>Mudbox</li>
        <li>Photoshop</li>
    </ul>
    And I am currently learning the wonderful world of Game Engines as well as Zbrush. As for coding thus far I am loving:
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        </ul> </p>
