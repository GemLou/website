        <h2>1.1 Describe <br> the content and layout for each page.</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class="leftp">
        <p> The layout for each page is very similar as I wanted to keep a consistent style throughout so I wasn't baffling myself too much with all of the design details. I decided to focus on a simple pink, black and grey style, with the same fonts throughout, I found it a lot easier this way. My page layouts are also very simple, with the use of buttons for links and different unit pages. On my home page I have a drop down which is also very simple looking. As I'm writing I haven't as of yet used any images but I really hope to get some images in next to my text.

    <div class="rightq">
        <h2>1.2 Describe copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class="rightp">
        <p>There are a few kinds of copyright, firstly when someone creates an image or a piece of work, that work is theirs and is copyrighted to them, if they give permission for you to use it then great, you can use that piece, however, some individuals will want credit, and YOU MUST give credit to them, if they see it and there is no credit and you are pulling this image off as your own, then your site could be at risk. I think this affects websites in both ways, the creator of the image may be reluctant to show further work as people have been taking it and not giving credit, and the people taking the images and not giving credit could have their site removed if further action is taken.
        <br>
        <br>
        The next form of copyright is logos. Taking logos and using these from large companies such as Apple, Cocacola etc, could get your site removed also, unless you explicitly say: "This is Apple's logo". I know this from past experience, I was creating videogame artwork for a T-shirt site called Redbubble, I used the Dragon Age Inquisition logo underneath some hand-drawn roses and flowers. Needless to say, after a day of it being up, it was soon taken down. Even though I had edited the logo completely, and it was slightly recognisable, they still did not like the use of their logo and others making money off it.
        <br>
        <br>
        So generally speaking, copyright could get your website taken down and this is how it mainly affects us. Other things such as GDPR also come into play, however I have discussed this previously.

    <div class="leftq1">
        <h2>1.3 Describe access issues that need taking into account.</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class="leftp">
        <p> So there's a few different access issues, for instance the main one, if people don't have wifi, how are they supposed to view the website? There's nothing we as a developer can do about this, but it is an access issue.
        <br>
        <br>
        The main one I want to discuss is disablity. People with certain disabilities may struggle to use a website, for instance, people who are blind, it would be great if there were accessibility options for the blind where the website could read the text to them, as well image descriptions, I think this is definitely something that needs considering in the future, it's a struggle for many blind people to go shopping and things, so if there were options where blind individuals could shop online, this would be amazing, and also if this could be implemented into other sites too.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="rightq">
        <h2>1.4 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites.</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class="rightp">
        <p>So for the website itself, the best file type to use is HTML; aLmost every single website you view will have something to do with HTML, it is one of the main web languages. HTML is a language and a file format. However there a few other extensions that I have seen mentioned, that are just as common as HTML, such as .php, .shtm (this takes coding from a seperate file, and we can basically put one webpage inside another.), but honestly I don't know much about these, so I think the best for me would be HTML.
        <br>
        <br>
        As for image file types for websites, gif is very popular, and great for images as well as animations. JPEG and PNG are also very popular for images, supposedly PNG's are to be used in place of GIFs, my favourite feature of PNG's is the ability to have a transparent background.JPEG files are super straightforward and mostly used for photos.</p>
